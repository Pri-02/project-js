The weather app is a simple web application that allows users to get the current weather conditions for any 
location in the world. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data, and it displays the data 
in a user-friendly format. The app has a simple, clean interface. The top of the page has a search bar where 
users can enter a city name to get the weather forecast for that city.
